	<h1>
		Hi , everybody!
	</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Maksym (Max) and I have arrived to Canada from Ukraine about 
		<time>
		9 months
		</time>
		 ago. Like Canada though. I have chosen Interactive Media Design because I am a creative person. I make music,draw and completely in love with various types of art. 
	<p>
		My goals in this course are to learn something new for myself and use all those skills in future . I did not have any experiences with web stuff before, so it is not easy for me, but I am trying my best (like to challenge myself).
	</p>
	<p>
		Except music and arts I like skateboarding, fixed gear bikes, vintage photography, travelling, expensive cars, stylish people and silence. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Wish you guys to succeed in this course and be happy!
